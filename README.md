This story was originally compiled by Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, librarians and philologists originating from Hanau, Hessen, Germany. Their first publication was in 1812, 200 years ago, in two volumes called "Stories for Children and the Home" or "Kinder und Hausmärchen".

The text for the story was adapted by Pastora Faval, along with the wonderful illustrations of Christiane Drapela, and the music of Martin Benavides based on a variation of the theme "Ein Männlein Steht Im Walde", making this version of Hansel & Gretel ideal for those of whom reading is not enough, but also enjoy living a story.
